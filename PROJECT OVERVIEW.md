# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project represents how a real e‑commerce company uses clickstream data to see exactly where money is being lost in the online buying journey and how to fix it.​

Page 1 : Conversion Funnel Page 

This dashboard shows how users move step‑by‑step through your site, from landing on the homepage to completing a purchase. It highlights how many users reach each stage (Homepage, Product Page, Add to Cart, Checkout, Purchase) and what percentage drop off between stages. The KPI cards on top summarize overall sessions, total orders, conversion rate, and average order value so you can quickly see how well the funnel is performing.

Page 2 : Traffic & Campaign Analysis Page 

This dashboard explains where your visitors and customers are coming from and how efficiently each channel converts. It compares traffic sources and campaigns (such as Google, Facebook, Email, etc.) on metrics like sessions, orders, conversion rate, revenue, and cost per acquisition. By reading it, you can immediately see which channels are driving the most sales for the lowest cost and which ones are underperforming or wasting budget.

Page 3 : Drop‑off / Drill‑through Page 

This dashboard focuses on why users abandon the funnel, especially after adding items to their cart. It lists detailed information about sessions or users who did not complete checkout, including their device type, browser, traffic source, and the last event before they dropped off. Filters and drill‑through actions let you zoom into specific segments (for example, mobile Chrome users from a particular campaign) so you can identify technical problems or UX issues causing high abandonment.

Business situation : 

An online store has plenty of visitors, but relatively few complete a purchase, and leaders do not know at which step customers drop off or which marketing channels are worth the spend. The project builds a data model and Power BI dashboards from raw web events and order data so product and marketing teams can see that journey clearly, stage by stage.
